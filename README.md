Protein Sequence Extraction from fastaq file

The present code can be directly downloaded on a Linux system, needs Python3.6. Run it directly from the terminal. And follow along cool user interactive features to automatically download & retrieve the data from the file(SRR7145317.fastq) mentioned in the question. Directly from the ENA database.

Above code dependencies:
1. Python 3.6 or (Python3 and above)

Use any below (2 or 3)
2. Linux OS for better performance and Bonus feature
3. For Window OS for only data extraction from the file feature active. (In windows OS bonus feature is not included herein cause of several reasons such as more package such as wget etc.. dependencies is required & timed out due to the large file in temp memory...)
*Also cause LINUX is way cooler  :-P
